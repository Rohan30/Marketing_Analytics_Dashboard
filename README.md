Month-over-month growth

Marketing Revenue contribution

Sub-channel mix

Organic: SEO, Content Marketing, Others

Referral: Affiliate, Blogs, Email Campaigns

Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by sub-channel

This allows stakeholders to identify:

High-volume but low-quality channels

High-CLV sub-channels worth scaling

Channels driving growth vs volatility

📈 Key Insights Highlighted

Social Media shows strong MoM growth in visitors and revenue, indicating scaling potential

Organic traffic delivers stable, high-quality users with strong CLV

Referral channels demonstrate mixed performance, requiring sub-channel optimization

Higher engagement does not always translate to higher conversions, emphasizing the need for funnel-level analysis

CLV variation across sub-channels supports reallocation of marketing spend
